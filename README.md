# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
  The purpose off this analysis is to determine if the there is bias in the reviews left between paid and unpaid reviewed. 

## Results:
### Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

  * How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there? Vine Reviews: 170, Non-Vine Reviews: 37823
  * How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? 65
  * How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars? 20605
  * What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? Approx 38%
  * What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars? Approx 54%

##Summary: 
### In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
  I would say based on the results, the Vine program does not show bias to more favorable reviews. Non Vine reviews were not only much more significant but also had a 54% of 5 star reviews compared to the 5 star vine reviews with a 38%. As an additional analysis we could run an analysis for each star review and determine if we can find a bias through those results as maybe we'll see a higher number of 4 star reviews or even if we see any low Vine reviews.
